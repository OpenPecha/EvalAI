After running these commands, you can check the status of your containers using:

docker-compose ps


docker-compose down -v

remove all images:
docker rmi -f $(docker images -aq)

docker-compose down --volumes --rmi all


### Key Points

- **Port Conflict Explanation:**  
  The "port is already allocated" error means that the required ports (e.g., 5432, 9324, 35729, 9125) are currently in use by existing containers or processes.

- **Checking Existing Containers:**  
  Use `docker ps -a` to list all running (and stopped) containers to identify which ones are using the conflicting ports.

- **Removing Unwanted Containers:**  
  Stopped containers won't free up ports if there are still running containers. You must stop and remove the running ones that are causing conflicts.

- **Commands to Stop and Remove Containers:**  
  Use `docker stop` to halt the containers, then `docker rm` to remove them from the system.

- **Verifying Port Usage:**  
  After stopping/removing, use `docker ps` or tools like `lsof` (e.g., `sudo lsof -i :5432`) to check that the ports are free.

- **Restarting Your Deployment:**  
  Once the conflicting containers are removed and the ports are free, re-run your `docker-compose up` command to start the deployment without issues.

### Bash Code Snippets for Future Use

1. **List All Containers:**
   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   ```

2. **Stop Specific Containers (Replace with your container names):**
   ```bash
   docker stop evala_ec2_statsd-exporter_1 evala_ec2_db_1 evala_ec2_sqs_1 evala_ec2_nodejs_1
   ```

3. **Remove Stopped Containers:**
   ```bash
   docker rm evala_ec2_statsd-exporter_1 evala_ec2_db_1 evala_ec2_sqs_1 evala_ec2_nodejs_1
   ```

4. **Clean Up Stopped Containers (if needed):**
   ```bash
   docker container prune
   ```

5. **Check Which Process Is Using a Specific Port (Example for port 5432):**
   ```bash
   sudo lsof -i :5432
   ```

6. **Restart Your Docker Deployment:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

Using these commands will help you manage and troubleshoot container conflicts and port allocation issues in the future.
